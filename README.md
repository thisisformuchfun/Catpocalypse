# Catpocalypse
Comedy-horror catpocalypse game of cats taking over the world!

Potential prompt:
Create the cinematic and playable intro sequence for a first-person adventure-horror-comedy game titled “Schrödinger’s Catpocalypse.”

Tone & Style:
Warm, indie slice-of-life at first — cozy lighting, soft pastel palette, lo-fi soundscape — that gradually turns uncanny, tense, and surreal. The transition should feel like a dream slipping into a nightmare, but still playful and humorous at moments.

Opening Scene:
You play as a millennial woman in a small apartment. Morning light filters through the blinds as your cat wakes you up. You explore your apartment, watch your roommate gaming, make breakfast, feed and pet your cat, then relax on the couch watching TV with your cat on your lap. The player can freely interact with household objects in this segment — turn on the kettle, pick up cereal boxes, pet the cat, change channels, etc.

Story Beats (Cinematic Transitions):

The News Moment: The roommate asks for the news. On “FauxNews,” you see chaos — cats everywhere. Switch to “SEENN,” same story, with a newsroom overtaken by cats and the headline “Breaking News: White House Overrun by Cats.”

The Split Begins: Your cat suddenly jumps down and starts shivering, emitting a low buzzing sound that fills the room. You and your roommate back away, unsure what’s happening.

Transformation Threat: The cat stops, locks eyes with you, and purrs menacingly. Suddenly, it leaps toward you like it’s attacking a bird. You and your roommate panic, sprint into the bedroom, and slam the door. Dialogue triggers:

Roommate: “Is this really happening? Cats attacking humans???”

You: “But she’s so cute, she can’t be evil!!”

Gameplay Shift (Tutorial Phase):
From here, the first-person shooter gameplay begins — but with a twist.

Instead of guns, the player uses cat toys, food cans, yarn balls, spray bottles, and laser pointers to fend off (or distract) increasingly aggressive but adorable cats.

Cats can alternate between cute, harmless behavior (purring, meowing, rubbing against you) and attack phases, where one lick converts you into a cat.

The tension mechanic is psychological — the closer you get to “adorable,” the more dangerous it becomes.

Objective:
Survive the initial cat incursion, protect the roommate, and find a way out of the apartment. Gameplay tone should mix humor and panic — like Goat Simulator meets Resident Evil meets Untitled Goose Game.

Music & Atmosphere:

Start with calm lo-fi or soft synth background music.

Transition to glitchy, distorted purrs and reversed meows as the world shifts.

Lighting should go from warm daylight to dim orange with flickering lamps.

Player Feel:
You should start the game feeling comfort and affection — but end the intro with confusion, disbelief, and dread. The first cat encounter must make the player question what’s real, setting the tone for the rest of the game.
